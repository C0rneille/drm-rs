//! # Property
//!
//! A property of a modesetting resource.
//!
//! All modesetting resources have a set of properties that have values that
//! can be modified. These properties are modesetting resources themselves, and
//! may even have their own set of properties.
//!
//! Properties may have mutable values attached to them. These can be changed by
//! either changing the state of a resource (thereby affecting the property),
//! directly changing the property value itself, or by batching property changes
//! together and executing them all atomically.
